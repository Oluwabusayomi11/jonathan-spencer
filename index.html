                    The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune <br> 500 companies has allowed me to developer a
                    skillset that <br> helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any <br> business
                </p>
      
                <p>
                    I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the <br> world's largest communities teaching young minds about
                    how <br> to sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new <br> world of opportunities.

                    As a developer, you have everything available to you and all <br> that's holding you back is
                    yourself.

                    "How big would you dream, if you knew you wouldn't
                    fail?" <br> You've already gone through the hardest parts being <br> a
                    developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader <br> in something you're passionate about.
